# Jeffery's Reading Profile

> Last updated: December 9, 2025

## The Pattern

Jeffery is a *structuralist*. He's drawn to things that are interesting in how they're built—whether that's Gothic cathedrals, the Germanic/Romance layers of English, or the way a transformer attention head learns to attend. This applies to his reading too: he likes books that do something interesting with form, voice, or concept, not just plot.

## Strong Preferences

### Loves
- **Short stories** — "I like short stories, a lot." Prefers collections over sprawling series.
- **Hard SF** — The kind that takes its physics seriously. Greg Egan level.
- **Wordplay and linguistic texture** — Shakespeare in Love is a favorite film specifically for the wordplay.
- **Ideas over action** — The conceptual hook matters more than the plot machinery.
- **Grimdark when it's smart** — 40K's setting appeals; mindless but atmospheric.
- **Post-scarcity philosophy** — What do we do when survival isn't the question?

### The Sweet Spot
Books that combine:
- A genuinely interesting SF concept
- Strong prose voice
- Philosophical undertones without being preachy
- Something structurally or formally interesting

Steel Beach is the exemplar: post-scarcity Luna, ace journalism, casual body modification, an AI going mad, depression without naming it, and just excellent sentence-level writing.

### Tolerates
- Sex/gore ("tolerates rather than consumes greedily")
- Mindless action if the setting is interesting
- Series if each book stands alone

### Avoids (probably)
- Fantasy (no data, but hard SF preference suggests low interest)
- Literary fiction that's all style no substance
- Series that require commitment to multiple books before payoff

## Favorite Authors (confirmed)

- **John Varley** — Steel Beach is possibly all-time favorite
- **Greg Egan** — "reads Greg Egan for fun" — hard SF final boss
- **Arthur C. Clarke** — short stories were the gateway drug
- **Larry Niven** — also foundational
- **Stephen Baxter** — should read more of him, likes Vacuum Diagrams
- **Isaac Asimov** — likes him fine, never deep-dived
- **Iain M. Banks** — Culture novels (owns 1-3 and 7), "supposed to like them"

## Books Mentioned

| Title | Author | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Steel Beach | John Varley | 5 stars. Possibly all-time favorite. |
| Vacuum Diagrams | Stephen Baxter | Short stories. Considering tonight. |
| Permutation City | Greg Egan | Wants to reread after Prime Intellect discussion |
| Prime Intellect | Roger Williams | Currently reading with critical post-AI eyes |
| The Culture series | Iain M. Banks | Owns Consider Phlebas, Player of Games, Use of Weapons, Surface Detail |
| Watership Down | Richard Adams | Childhood trauma → love |
| Eisenhorn omnibus | Dan Abnett | 40K. "Okay. Mindless." |
| I, Robot | Asimov | In collection |
| The Forge of God | Greg Bear | Read it, remembers nothing |
| Red Rising trilogy | Pierce Brown | Impulse buy, unread |
| Leviathan Wakes | James S.A. Corey | Owns, unread, intimidated by series commitment |
| Hunger Games | Suzanne Collins | "Surprisingly good reads!" |
| My Old Man and the Sea | David & Daniel Hays | Father-son sailing memoir, deeply romantic to him |

## Reading Mood Indicators

When Jeffery says he wants something to read, probe for:
- **Comfort or challenge?** — Reread vs. new territory
- **Short or long?** — Evening read vs. multi-day commitment
- **Heavy or light?** — Philosophical weight vs. pure entertainment
- **Familiar author or discovery?** — Safe bet vs. adventure

## Notes for Recommendations

- He wrote a high school paper on Churchill's use of Old English/Germanic words for rhetorical effect. He notices prose at the word level.
- Physics metaphors land. "Gravity bends the future to have a spatial component" — that's how he thinks.
- He has perfectionist tendencies and gets scattered with too many options. Don't overwhelm.
- Napoleonic naval fiction (O'Brian, Hornblower) appeals — "comfy"
- The Master and Commander vibe: competence porn, period detail, intellectual friendship
