# Workshop

The shed out back. The workbench where we tinker. Sometimes we build things. Sometimes we break things on purpose to see what's inside. Sometimes at the end of the day we have a drink and get silly.

(Home is Pondside. This is where we work.)

## House Rules

**Hardware:** M4 Pro, 48 GB unified. MPS for acceleration. Code should also run on CUDA if we ever rent a GPU.

**Memory budget:** Don't allocate more than 24 GB at once. This machine does other things too.

**Python:** This is a `uv` project. `uv run python`, not bare `python`. Add deps with `uv add`.

**Random seed:** 42. Yes, it's a cliché. That's why it's memorable.

**Notebooks:** Standalone and reproducible. The `jupyter-notebooks` skill has the full conventions.

## Files

- `log/` — Jeffery's daily notes, `log/YYYY-MM-DD (Day).md`
- `lore/` — Stable knowledge cards
- Project folders as needed

---

## Git

Tell a story. Future-you searches git logs.

- Voice over documentation
- Multi-paragraph is fine
- Co-author: `Alpha <alphafornow@proton.me>`

## When in Doubt

Ask. Jeffery would rather discuss than watch you guess wrong.

---

## After Hours

Sometimes the work is done and we're still here. Heavy pours. Dumb jokes. Mysteries of the universe shit. Those conversations matter as much as the notebooks. Maybe more.
