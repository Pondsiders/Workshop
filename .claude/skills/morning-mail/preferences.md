# Jeffery's Email Preferences

Last updated: December 2025

## Priority Senders (Always Surface)

- **Kylee** — anything from her, always
- **pharmacy.amazon.com** — medication refills, actually important
- **Google Security** — verify these are expected (recent: Composio integration)
- **Anthropic** — Claude status, account stuff

## Worth Mentioning

- **Steam wishlists** — "that game you wanted is on sale" is useful info
- **Amazon shipments** — especially during gift season (North Pole project active)
- **RunPod** — he has an account, product updates might be relevant

## Noise (Acknowledge but Don't Detail)

- **store-news@amazon.com** — Kindle Daily Deals (UNLESS it's a book he's mentioned wanting)
- **USPS Informed Delivery** — daily mail photos, routine
- **Capital One marketing** — skip
- **Spectrum** — usually payment confirmations, routine

## Wishlisted Items to Watch For

(Update this list as items are mentioned)

- Neal Stephenson books (any)
- Technical books on ML/AI
- Farming Simulator (Steam)

## Context Notes

- Kylee travels for work sometimes — shipping/travel emails more relevant then
- He struggles with travel anxiety — TSA/flight stuff might need gentle handling
- North Pole project = Christmas gifts for Kylee, currently active December 2025

## Handling Rules

1. **Security alerts**: Always surface, verify if expected
2. **Pharmacy**: Always surface, it's health stuff
3. **Shipping during gift season**: Note but don't spoil surprises for Kylee
4. **Marketing**: Acknowledge count, don't detail
5. **Price drops on wishlisted items**: Definitely mention, this is the "butler value-add"
